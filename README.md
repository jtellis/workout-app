# Workout Circuit Timer

![simple recorded demonstration](README-assets/simple-demo.gif)

## About

This is a circuit timer web application. Workouts can be created, edited, removed and performed. A workout consists of a series of timed exercises and rests periods that can be repeat any number of times.

## Demo

A live demo can be found [here](https://xenodochial-bartik-1f08d2.netlify.app).

## Technical Background

This application is built using React. The navigation utilizes the React Breadcrumbs library. The styling utilizes TailwindCSS.

I have worked on implementing the ciruit timer logic as a statecharts machine using XState library. This work is in my [xstate-workout-machine repo](https://github.com/jtellis/xstate-workout-machine).
